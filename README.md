# Kachi

Kachi is a simple tool for backing up valuable files, such as dotfiles, config files, and any directory you wish to backup. 

By creating a short yaml file, you can declaratively decide what to back up, and where. 

Kachi uses "profiles", which allow you to backup different files and directories to different locations, and potentially on different schedules (if you automate it further).

```txt
➜ .\kachi.exe --help

 Usage: kachi.exe [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

## Installing

Kachi is deployed as a single executable file that you can [download from the releases page](https://github.com/EndlessTrax/kachi/releases). Once downloaded, move it to a location that makes sense for your system and OS, and add it to your PATH. 

> NOTE: If a compatable executable for your OS and architecture isn't available, please create an issue or upvote a current one so it can moved up in priority and added to future releases.

## Configuration

By default, Kachi looks for a configuration file at `.config/kachi/config.yaml` relative to the user's home directory on all systems. You can specify a different configuration location using the `--config` flag (see usage example below.)

As mentioned above, you can declare different profiles under the top-level `profiles` key. Profiles can be named almost anything you want. The only exception is the `default` profile. While not required, the `default` profile is a handy way of reducing repetition in your configuration file. Any source added to the default profile will be added to all other profiles automatically when backed up.

Example:

```yaml
profiles:
  default:
    sources:
      - ".gitconfig"
    backup_destination: "path/to/backup/location/"
    
  profile_1:
    sources:
      - ".bashrc"
```

> NOTE: A fuller [example of the config.yaml](examples\example.yaml) file can be found in the example folder.

In the above example, if you backup `profile_1`, both the `.gitconfig` and `.bashrc` files will be backed up to the default `backup_destination`. If a `backup_destination` was declared in `profile_1`, then that would take precedence.

> NOTE: Additional config formats will be added in future (such as `json` or `ini`), but please see issues and upvote any you wish to be added next to help prioritize formats.

## Usage

To back up the declared sources from your configuration, use the `backup` command with optional flags:

```txt
➜ .\kachi.exe backup --help

 Usage: kachi.exe backup [OPTIONS]

 Backup files and directories.
 If no profile is specified, all profiles in the configuration file will be backed up.
 If no configuration file is specified, the default configuration file path will be
 used.

╭─ Options ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ --config         TEXT  Path to a configuration file                                  
│ --profile        TEXT  Name of the profile to backup                                 
│ --help                 Show this message and exit.                                   
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Without any flags, all profiles will be backed up using a config file in the expected default location. Alternatively, specify a single profile to backup with `--profile`:

```shell
kachi backup --profile profile_1 
```

Or specify a configuration to use using `--config`:

```shell
kachi backup --config some/other/path/config.yaml
```
